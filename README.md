# EEG Classification Project 
The goal of this project is to classify different activities based on EEG recordings using machine learning methods. Three different datasets were investigated:
“Music” dataset 
Subject listens to classical music, hip-hop music, and white-noise in three separate recordings. 
“Think-count” dataset 
In the same recording, the subject switches between counting only in their mind (“think”) and counting aloud (“count”).
“Think-read” dataset 
In the same recording, the subject switches between reading only in their mind (“think”) and reading aloud (“read”). 
Each EEG recording contains 32 channels of readings sampled at 128 samples/s.
